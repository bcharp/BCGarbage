Inside this there is a class name BCGarbage, it allows you to set a non preexisting variable. like [myObject setToto:@"titi"]; with no property or variable named toto. Works with kvc too, [myObject setValue:@"titi" forKey:@"toto"];

There is still warning in code.
Basically I think that you can made really ugly stuff with that.
I made it for fun, but that should be good for the app store.
So if you do something with that I really want to know what.
